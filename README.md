# GNU Core utilities in Rust

I am Shafin Murani, and this is my little project to recreate some easy command line utilities present in the GNU Core utilities. Just because it'll help me practice.

I write articles on this on my [30 Days of learning Rust series](https://medium.com/@shafinmurani/list/30-days-of-rust-b1dfd024617c)

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/shafinmurani/github/gnu-core-utils-rust/
```

Go to the project directory

```
cd gnu-core-utils-rus
```

Pick whatever you want to run 

```
cd ls
```

Run it 

```
cargo run 
```
